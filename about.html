        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Green Motors is a startup company based in Des Moines, Iowa. We started the company because we believe in electric vehicles, but we wanted to offer an alternative choice to consumers other than the biggest motor companies. We began selling electric car accessories, including chargers. Our company has a friendly work culture and we value passion, innovation, and care.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the first things we did as a company was create a strong research division that strives to innovate and find new solutions. Ultimately the goal is making things greener and cheaper for our customers. We put time and care into crafting a perfect product that is efficient, cheap, and environmentally friendly. An example of this is the electric car chargers we offer for cheaper than the bigger companies.
        </p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
            We don't just care about carbon emissions but also the impacts of sourcing resources. Many motor companies get the materials for their products from the cheapest source rather than the cleanest, while we research and communicate with companies to find better alternatives. The product of all our hard-work and care is a series of first class electric motorcycles that we want to bring to the world.
