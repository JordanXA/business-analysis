                <p class="fs-4">
                    Green Motors is a startup company based in Des Moines, Iowa. We started the company because we
                    believe
                    in electric vehicles, but we wanted to offer an alternative choice to consumers other than the
                    biggest
                    motor companies. We began selling electric car accessories, including chargers. Our company has a
                    friendly work culture and we value passion, innovation, and care.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-4">
                    One of the first things we did as a company was create a strong research division that strives to
                    innovate and find new solutions. Ultimately the goal is making things greener and cheaper for our
                    customers. We put time and care into crafting a perfect product that is efficient, cheap, and
                    environmentally friendly. An example of this is the electric car chargers we offer for cheaper than
                    the
                    bigger companies.
                </p>

                <h2 class="display-1">Mission</h2>
                <p class="fs-4">
                    We don't just care about carbon emissions but also the impacts of sourcing resources. Many motor
                    companies get the materials for their products from the cheapest source rather than the cleanest,
                    while
                    we research and communicate with companies to find better alternatives. The product of all our
                    hard-work
                    and care is a series of first class electric motorcycles that we want to bring to the world.
                </p>
